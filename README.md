# Classification and Geometry of Neural Manifolds

Given the neural manifolds data (feature extranctions from deep networks), the code computes manifold dimension, and manifold radius, center-center correlations and the estimated manifold perceptron capacity (given random 50%/50% plus/minus dichotomy).
